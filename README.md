# karmegeddon

Kerbin's love the movie Karmageddon! Despite the science being completely inaccurate, a petition has received enough signatures to launch a dress rehearsal.

We will launch our Freedom Orbiter with our Karmadillo mining rover. After refueling at the Kir Space Station, we will intercept an asteroid near the Mun. The one we placed there during our more scientifically accurate Asteroid Redirect mission.

Is this wise? No. Will this gain public acclaim and more funds for our space program? YES.
